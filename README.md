# DDR2_controller

DDR2 RAM controller is a digital circuit that manages the flow of data going to and from the computer's main memory. A memory controller can be a separate chip or integrated into another chip, such as being placed on the same die or as an integral part of a microprocessor.

The main components of the DDR2 RAM Controller are implemented in XILINX ISE to demonstrate its working principle as a part of VLSI course @ IIITH.
